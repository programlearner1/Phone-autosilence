# 📍 Location-Based Auto Actions App

### 🔥 Automate Phone Modes & Messaging Based on Location

Welcome to the **Location-Based Auto Actions App** – a smart Android solution that automatically toggles phone modes (Silent/General) and sends custom SMS notifications when entering or leaving specified locations. 🚀

---

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Auto-Switch Phone Mode**: Automatically switch to silent mode when entering a geofenced area and revert to general mode when leaving.  
✅ **Custom SMS Notifications**: Send personalized messages to selected contacts when you reach a specific location.  
✅ **Dynamic Radius Selection**: Easily adjust the geofence radius for each location.  
✅ **Multiple Location Support**: Add, edit, and manage multiple saved locations.  
✅ **Live Map Integration**: Visual representation of geofenced areas with an interactive map.  
✅ **Persistent Data**: All locations are stored locally for future reference.  

---

## 📱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (with Leaflet.js for mapping)
- **Backend**: None (Client-side local storage used for persistence)
- **APIs**: OpenCageData for geocoding
